<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are three different datasets used for this project and animation. These three datasets combined contain the overall information of the geometry of the different countries in Africa, the crop yields for those countries split out into their respective crop type, and the average precipitation in depth for those countries. I will go into each of these more in depth down below. Overall, I created an R script to read in these different files and produce an HTML file that contains the animation of the crop yields and the precipitation amount for each year from 1961 to 2018.</p>
<p>The first dataset was that which contained the geometry of the different countries in Africa and was in a geojson format.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It contained the variables cartodb_id, geometry, adm0_a3 (shortened country names), name (county’s full names), created_at (date), updated_at (date) but I only used the name and geometry variables. This dataset was going to be used as the basis for the mapping of the other information and only contained that basic information. As such the only value changes I made to it was in the names as there were slight differences in how some country names were written between the data sets and I wanted to merge them based on this field. A slight change I made in the script itself was when it read in this geojson file it converts it to an sf object.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This conversion was because I am more familiar with how to use and plot sf objects in R than I am for geojson objects.</p>
<p>The second dataset was where the majority of the information for this project came from. It was from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and I was able to download crop yield information for each year from 1961-2018 in all African countries from the bulk downloads Africa for crop production.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This file contained more variables than the others with Area Code, Area (Country name), Item Code, Item (Crop type), Element (area harvest, crop yield, production, unit (ha, hg/ha, tonnes), a variable to represent each year and another to contain any flags for that particular year. However, I only ended up using Area, Item, Element, Unit and the variables that represented the values for each year (I did not use the flags). For this dataset I did have to do some formatting after reading in the csv file. The first thing I did was change all the N/A values to zero. The next couple of things I did were filtering the data so that I only had rows whose element was crop yields, this in turn also made it so unit was all in hg/ha. I also got rid of the columns that I wasn’t going to be using at all. After that I decided to do two different things for the data the first being aggregating the data so that I had the total crop yields for all of the different crops per year for each country. This was so I could see overall changes in agriculture. The second thing was filtering the item (crop type) so that I only was aggregating the crop yields per country for each year for groundnuts, wheat, cereals, cassava, millet, and maize. I selected these particular crop types as they are some of the major crops grown in Africa.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> From there I also altered the Area (country names) to match that of the first dataset and then I merged the two different versions of crop yields to that data set so I could show the yields on the map of Africa.</p>
<p>The third dataset was a xlsx file I downloaded from The World Bank after filtering the data on their website to include all the years it had the data for and all the countries that I was looking at for this project.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This file contained the names of the countries and the average precipitation data in mm for each year. Though I was using this data for the full-time frame of 1961 - 2018, this data set only had the values for about every 5 years of that timeframe. As such I decided to show the precipitation data for the year that it was first recorded and update it whenever it changed values. I did do some manual editing of this file before loading it into R but it was mainly deleting unneeded rows or things similar to that. I did finish formatting this file after I read it into R by finishing selecting only the columns that had data and updating the names of the countries to match how it was in the geometry and crop yields datasets. Finally, I merged this information into both versions of the crop yields and geometry data frame.</p>
<p>After formatting and combining the above data sets into two different versions (total_crop_yield and selected_crop_yield) I moved onto the visualization. For the visualization I decided to go with an animation that showed the changes in crop yields and precipitation data for each year. As the focus of this project is on crop yields, I decided to create a graph for each year that plotted the geometry of the Africa countries and shaded them based off a crop yield scale.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> For this scale I decided to preset the limits (min and max) as well as the midpoint so that the shading and key would be consistent across the years and comparing different year’s graphs would therefore also be easier. I determine what these values should be I looked at the two different versions and their respective values. The next thing I added was labels that identified which country was what and also noted the average precipitation levels in mm underneath those names. Finally, I used the animation package to create an HTML file (and its associated files and folders) that animated the different graphs across the years. Due to those associated files and folders to see each version based off the html file you do need to rerun that part of the script when switching back and forth.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, to create the videos you see above, I just screen recorded the html animation and then edited out parts of the video in an editor. Thank you to Professor Davis who finished cropping off some extra parts of the screen in the recording so you don’t see the browser’s search bar.</p>
